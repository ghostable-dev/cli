**Ghostable** is a secure, Laravel-friendly platform for managing and sharing environment variables across projects and CI pipelines. This repository contains the CLI client used to interact with that platform.

Ghostable stores and organizes your `.env` variables, validates them, and integrates seamlessly into your development workflowâ€”locally or in CI.
